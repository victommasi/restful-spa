### Restful Single Page Application 
Using a custom template, I built this Angular Single Page Application, which consumes a RESTful service, supported by some Backend Technologies such as Java, Spring and Hibernate.

### Stack:
* Java
* SpringBoot
* Angularjs
* Hibernate/JPA
* Spring Mvc
* Spring Data Jpa
* Bootstrap
* MySQL

### Mapping:
```sh
GET request to /customer/ -> returns a list of customers
GET request to /customer/1 -> returns the user with ID 1
POST request to /customer/ -> with a customer object as JSON  creates a new customer
PUT request to /customer/3 -> with a customer object as JSON updates the customer with ID 3
DELETE request to /customer/4 -> deletes the customer with ID 4
```
